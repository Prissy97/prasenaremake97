        <center><p>I've always had people tell me I could'nt do this, or I could'nt do that, but everything changed sophomore year of high school. I attended Oak Park High School and became one of the best tumblers and cheerleaders Oak Park has ever had. I would'nt consider myself popular, but I was cool with everybody.</p></center>

        <center><p>After graduating with an 3.7 grade point average and a high ACT score of 28, I attend Spelman College in Atlanta, GA. Attending an HBCU gives you, as an African American, a lot of impotance about your culture. I've also met so many people outside of my city, from Chicago, Il to Tampa, Fl.</p></center>

        <center><p>Having a job in college is very important. I have two jobs at college, one is a part time work study job and the other is a part time job but off campus. Work study is optional for you to have through FASFA (Financial Aid) but it's best you get it, so you could have a job while attending school. It's also best for you to apply for jobs back home. I have two jobs back home. One is only a part time summer job and the other I work full time at a plant.</p></center>

        <center><p>Looking back at everyone that ever doubted me, I believe I came out with the win. I'm in college, I make good money, I am a humble person, and good things happen to good people! I wish the best to everyone that doubted me.</p></center>
